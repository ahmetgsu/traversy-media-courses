1. Create a routes folder in main root directory
2. Create auth.js file. This will be /auth route.
3. In auth.js file, do following configurations:

   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();

   // As we're in auth.js file /google will lead us to /auth/google route
   router.get('/google', (req, res) => {
   res.send('auth');
   });

   module.exports = router;

4. In app.js file we need to have a link to auth.js file. That's loading the file to use the routes

   // Load Routes
   const auth = require('./routes/auth');

5. Right above the port, we need to add codes for using that routes as follows:

   // Use Routes
   app.use('/auth', auth);

---

IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGY

1.  In config folder, create a passport.js file in which we will define our strategy and write initial codes as follows:

        const GoogleStrategy = require('passport-google-oauth20').Strategy;
        const mongoose = require("mongoose");
        const keys = require("./keys");

        module.exports = function(passport) {

        }

2.  In the app.js, we need to require passport.js file

    const passport = require('passport');

        // Passport Config
        require('./config/passport')(passport);

3.  Then, we gonna define a strategy in passport.js

         module.exports = function(passport) {
           passport.use(
             new GoogleStrategy(
               {
                 clientID: keys.googleClientID,
                 clientSecret: keys.googleClientSecret,
                 callbackURL: '/auth/google/callback',
                 proxy: true
               },
               (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {
                 console.log(accessToken);
                 console.log(profile);
               }
             )
           );
         };

we added "proxy: true" beacuse heroku deploys with "https" and this will prevent us to get error

4.  In the auth.js, we will import passport

         const passport = require('passport');

         // As we're in auth.js file /google will lead us to /auth/google route
         router.get(
           '/google',
           passport.authenticate('google', { scope: ['profile', 'email'] })
         );

---

In section 41, we set up google strategy in passport.js file and we are able to go /auth/google route. But as we do not have our callback function we get an error message as follows in the /auth/google route after logged in: Cannot GET /auth/google/callback.

Normally we need to have a callback function as defined in the passport-google-oauth20 web site

          app.get('/auth/google/callback',
            passport.authenticate('google', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
            function(req, res) {
              // Successful authentication, redirect home.
              res.redirect('/');
            });

In section 42, we will be dealing with this callback function.

1.  In auth.js, we paste the code below and modify a bit

           router.get(
             '/google/callback',
             passport.authenticate('google', { failureRedirect: '/' }),
             (req, res) => {
               // Successful authentication, redirect dashboard.
               res.redirect('/dashboard');
             }
           );

2.  In passport.js, we have written console.log for accessToken and profile. When we try to sign-in we get those information in console. We will use mongoose to take profile information and format it in a way that we want and insert it into mangoose. In order to do that, we need to create mongoose module.

3.  We deployed our changes to heroku.
    git add .
    git commit -am "handled auth"
    git push heroku master

4.  We then go to heroku app and open up the application. We try to go the link: https://agile-inlet-11133.herokuapp.com/auth/google. But it gives an error. Because we've solely added http://localhost:5000 to Authorized JavaScript origins section.

        4.1 First, in console.developers.google.com we select the storybooks project on top left side. Then, in the left side bar we go to OAUth consent screen to add "agile-inlet-11133.herokuapp.com" link to Authorized domains.

        4.2 After that, select Credentials and click on "Web client 1" underneath of the Credentials. Then, we add https://agile-inlet-11133.herokuapp.com to Authorized JavaScript origins.

        4.3 On the other hand, we must add https://agile-inlet-11133.herokuapp.com/auth/google/callback to Authorized redirect URIs section

SECTION 7-43: CREATING THE USER MODEL

In this chapter, we will implement mongoose and connect our MongoDB Atlas dev database(db) and create a user model

1.  In app.js, we brought mongoose but we've not connected yet. So, we'll do that. But first we need to bring (load) the keys in app.js file.

          // Load Keys
          const keys = require('./config/keys');

2.  Then, we connect mongoose as follows:

          // Mongoose Connect
          mongoose
            .connect(keys.mongoURI, {
              useNewUrlParser: true,
              useUnifiedTopology: true
            })
            .then(() => console.log('MongoDB connected'))
            .catch(err => console.log(err));

3.  We create "models" folder in root directory and inside of it we create User.js file.

            const mongoose = require('mongoose');
            const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

            // Create Schema
            const UserSchema = new Schema({
              googleID: {
                type: String,
                required: true
              },
              email: {
                type: String,
                required: true
              },
              firstName: {
                type: String
              },
              lastName: {
                type: String
              },
              image: {
                type: String
              }
            });

            // Create collection and add schema
            mongoose.model('users', UserSchema);

---

SECTION 7-44: SAVING THE AUTHENTICATED USER

In this section we are going to take some of the user profile info and we put them into database.

1.  In passport.js, we create a newUser object variable in which we have all info we want to save into database

            const image = profile.photos[0].value;

            const newUser = {
              googleID: profile.id,
              firstName: profile.name.givenName,
              lastName: profile.name.familyName,
              email: profile.emails[0].value,
              image: image
            };

2.  Then, we check if the user exist in database or not

            // Check for existing user
                    User.findOne({
                      googleID: profile.id
                    }).then(user => {
                      if (user) {
                        // Return user
                        done(null, user);
                      } else {
                        // Create user
                        new User(newUser).save().then(user => done(null, user));
                      }

3.  If user exist in db, it returns the existing user, if not, it creates a new user, saves it into db and then return it.

4.  In app.js, we need to load the user model:

              // Load user model
              require('./models/User');

---

SECTION 7-45: ADDING SESSION AND AUTHENTICATION

In this section we will add the rest of the things to passport.js to actually work and to authenticate.

In passportjs.org/docs/ we have the following information about sessions:

Sessions
In a typical web application, the credentials used to authenticate a user will only be transmitted during the login request. If authentication succeeds, a session will be established and maintained via a cookie set in the user's browser.

Each subsequent request will not contain credentials, but rather the unique cookie that identifies the session. In order to support login sessions, Passport will serialize and deserialize user instances to and from the session.

passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {
done(null, user.id);
});

passport.deserializeUser(function(id, done) {
User.findById(id, function(err, user) {
done(err, user);
});
});

In this example, only the user ID is serialized to the session, keeping the amount of data stored within the session small. When subsequent requests are received, this ID is used to find the user, which will be restored to req.user.

The serialization and deserialization logic is supplied by the application, allowing the application to choose an appropriate database and/or object mapper, without imposition by the authentication layer.

1.  Serialize User: in passport.js, at the bottom of module.exports we add the following codes:

              passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
                done(null, user.id);
              });

2.  Deserialize User:

              passport.deserializeUser((id, done) => {
                User.findById(id).then(user => done(null, user));
              });

3.  In app.js we need to add passport middleware:
    In a Connect or Express-based application, passport.initialize() middleware is required to initialize Passport. If your application uses persistent login sessions, passport.session() middleware must also be used.

              // Passport middleware
              app.use(passport.initialize());
              app.use(passport.session());

---

SECTION 8-46: INDEX ROUTES AND HANDLEBARS

We'll shorten the code in app.js. First, in routes folder, we create a file named index.js.

1.  In index.js, we set up the initial configuration as follows:

              const express = require('express');
              const router = express.Router();

              router.get('/', (req, res) => {
                res.send('It works');
              });

              module.exports = router;

2.  Then, in app.js we first load the index route on top and use it at the bottom.

3.  we install our view engine: npm i --save express-handlebars

4.  As ususal, we have to bring it in app.js on the top of the file

              const exphbs = require('express-handlebars');

5.  We need to add middleware for handlebars.
